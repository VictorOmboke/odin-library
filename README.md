This project is meant to showcase my understanding of objects and object constructors by creating a library application.

This project has a healthy balance of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I struggled the most with the JS more specifically figuring out how to effectively take the user data and displaying it in a card like format.
I was very comfortable styling this project using CSS as I got to use the auto-fit and minmax() properties for the grid layout that I chose to go with regarding how the data will be displayed to the user.

Overall, this was a cool yet challenging project and I have learned a lot about constructors and their utility as well as how to display user information from a form which is something we come across very often in our day to day lives.
